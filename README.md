## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
i guess one of the main challenges i faced was that i was going to use grid for the layout and have a header, sidebar, content, and footer, but ended up facing issues invloving grid. i believe these were caused by my lack of understanding of react, and the solution i used to combat this was to just use flex-box instead of grid, and choose to not add a footer.
